              Deltic Business Solutions came to us, at Gigawaffle, asking for a
              website and social media content, but they didn&apos;t have a plan
              on how any of this would look visually. As a new business, they
              didn&apos;t have anything established, so we set on developing a
              visual identity for them, which would end up being used for their
              website, social media and physical marketing, such as business
              cards and flyers. They ethos was to make running your business a
              simple task, through aiding you with business utilities, insurance
              and payments.

                After talking with the client, we found out that the name
                Deltic, was inspired by the Deltic train, so we initial looked
                at the trains colour as part of the colour scheme. Due to the
                dark theme preference our client had, the teal colour of the
                Deltic train clashed a bit too much with the darker colours in
                the pallette. Instead, we opted for a shade of green not too far
                off the teal, which really popped against the darker colours.
                After experimenting with some complementary colours, we opted
                for a more pale shade of green.
                <br />
                <br />
                Given the informative nature of Deltic Business Solutions, we
                determined that focusing on readible was key to helping create a
                good user experience on the website. Therefore, we opted for the
                font Overpass, which was used throughout the branding in varying
                weights.

                The website had to showcase their different services, i.e.
                insurance, utilities and payments, whilst maintaining
                consistency in colours, visual style and font. Finding imagery
                which properly resonated with their brand was important, because
                this would not only tie the website together, but would become
                important for their social media and brand image as a whole.
                <br />
                <br />
                The darker colours were used for the background of the website,
                with white being used for the text (which was great for
                readability) and with the green being used as an accent colour.
                Opting for this arrangement allowed the vital information to pop
                in the dark environment its in.

                  When it came to social media, we believed that being strong
                  imagery was neccessary to catch peoples eye. We created posts
                  which were rather simplistic by nature, provided value with
                  through their captions. We set out a posting pattern which
                  allowed all of their services to get equal coverage across
                  social media. The image provided most of the colour, with a
                  simple message within a green box or circle and the logo in
                  the corner, it tied the social media posts in with the visual
                  identity we&apos;d established for them.
