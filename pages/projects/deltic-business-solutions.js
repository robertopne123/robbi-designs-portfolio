          "Deltic Business Solutions came to us, when I was at Gigawaffle, asking for a website and social media content, but they didn&apos;t have a plan on how any of this would look visually. As a new business, they didn&apos;t have anything established, so we set on developing a visual identity for them, which would end up being used for their website, social media and physical marketing, such as business cards and flyers. Their ethos was to make running your business a simple task, through aiding you with business utilities, insurance and payments.",
          "After talking with the client, we found out that the name Deltic, was inspired by the Deltic train, so we initial looked at the trains colour as part of the colour scheme. Due to the dark theme preference our client had, the teal colour of the Deltic train clashed a bit too much with the darker colours in the pallette. Instead, we opted for a shade of green not too far off the teal, which really popped against the darker colours. After experimenting with some complementary colours, we opted for a more pale shade of green.",
          "Given the informative nature of Deltic Business Solutions, we determined that focusing on readible was key to helping create a good user experience on the website. Therefore, we opted for the font Overpass, which was used throughout the branding in varying weights.",
