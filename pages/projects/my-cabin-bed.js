          "Whilst at Gigawaffle, My Cabin Bed came to us for a redesign of their existing website. They sold unique wooden children's furniture and their existing website lacked consistency and looked unprofessional. It lacked a consistent colour scheme, typography and imagery, and as a result, this needed deciding before I set foot on redesigning their website.",
          "Their website featured yellows, greens, browns, blacks and whites, which created a lack of consistency through their website. I narrowed this to just three colours, green, black and white. I picked some new fonts which boasted great readability and then set out on laying out their redesigned pages. I made some adjustments to the page structure, which helped the pages flow better throughout a customers buying journey.",
          "I softened the websites elements by introducing rounded corners to the button and drop down elements, which helped create a modern, clean experience for My Cabin Bed's customers.",
