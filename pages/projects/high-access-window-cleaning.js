          "Whilst at Gigawaffle, High Access Window Cleaning came to us regarding a website redesign. Their existing website seemed to lack consistency and had issues with formatting when being used on a mobile phone. Therefore, it was in a dire need of a redesign. After a discussion with the client, they preferred to keep the colour scheme and content of the website the same, with a much cleaner look.",
          "I set out designing the pages with consistency and readability being the main focus. I cleaned up some of the images and made sure that they we're correctly scaled in proportion to the rest of the website, which was an issue with their previous website. I added a couple new features such as a testimonials section and a before & after comparision section. They had some great reviews as a company and it was only fair that they were publicised.",
          "Given the informative nature of Deltic Business Solutions, we determined that focusing on readible was key to helping create a good user experience on the website. Therefore, we opted for the font Overpass, which was used throughout the branding in varying weights.",
