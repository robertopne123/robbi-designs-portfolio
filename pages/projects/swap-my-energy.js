          "After some discussion with the client, we decided on a colour scheme, fonts and imagery that would help push sustainability as the brands aim, i.e. imagery depicting solar panels, wind turbines and other forms of renewable energy. I opted for isometric designs of energy equipment and images of a home setting to provide a familiar and warm feeling to their branding.",
          "Swap My Energy boasts both residential and commercial offerings in regards to energy, connections and water, therefore needed branding that would serve well for both their residential and commercial services. Therefore, we decided on having an adapted colour scheme and business-focused imagery for the commercial side of Swap My Energy, which helped differentiate the two sides, yet keep them recognisable as one business.",
