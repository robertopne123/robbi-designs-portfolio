          "The Food Connect was a new food delivery platform that was being developed, but they didn't have any branding, potential business capture forms or social media content for promotion. Whilst I was at Gigawaffle, we were asked to help them out. I conceptualised a few ideas which focused on using visual themes and colours commonly associated with food delivery, takeaways and fast food. Reds, oranges and yellow we're commonly used, and after gaining feedback from the client, we agreed on a colour scheme involving reds, blacks and whites.",
          "The Food Connect was split into two different sides of the business, the customer facing delivery side and the business facing commercial side. Both of these needed properly representing with the companies branding, so as a result, I was very particular on the imagery picked (food preperation, order management, etc., used for business - and delivery, home, etc., used for the customer facing side). As well as this, there was a seperate logo variant designed for the business side of the business. Their brand misson statement, was to allow takeaways take back control from huge delivery companies by offering their own ordering/delivery pages.",
          "Once the branding was established, I designed a landing page, which was to be used by sales staff during field sales, as well as to capture any new sign ups online. To raise awareness of the opportunities offered by The Food Connect, we designed them some content for both sides of their business.",
